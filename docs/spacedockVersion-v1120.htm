<h3> v.1.1.2.0 - Stall Alert! aka Stall Tactics</h3>
<p>
  <ul { list-style-type: square;}>
    <li><b>[NEW]</b> Optional difficulty settings for moderate and hard play - stall. Don't run out of EC or the fuel cells will stop functioning since they need electricity to function. Thank you to LinuxGuruGamer for the Setting.cs code and assistance.</li>
    <li><b>[NEW]</b>feature: autoSwitch (disabled for hard play). If current fuel mode is lacking fuel, will automatically look for another that has fuel.</li>
    <li><b>[NEW]</b>the group label on the PAW/RMB part window now reflects status of the fuel cell so you don't have to expand the group to peek in to see if the refrigerator light is on. thank you to @Blowfish, @Dmagic, and @LinuxGuruGamer for the assist. That is one LONG piece of code.</li>
    <li>PAW group label now in *living color*</li>
    <li>removed attempt at adding color to PAW group label.  those coders have been sacked.</li>
    <li>continued working on [BUG 0.0.1.9b]</li>
    <li>/*CODE*/</li>
    <ul { list-style-type: square;}>
      <li> udfs - updateFS</li>
      <li> udft - updateFT</li>
    </ul>
    <li><color=darkred><b>[NEW][BUG 1.1.2.0a] </b>Tweakscale will not scale module ODFC because onLoad() vs onStart issues?</color></li>
    <li><color=darkred><b>[NEW][BUG 1.1.2.0b] </b>Kerbalism doesn't seem to recognize the unique brilliance of ODFC, not their fault hard to see when its that bright. :D</color></li>
    <li>reversed removal of color coding PAW label. those coders have been sacked, and those sackers of the previously sacked are now extra-judicially *sacked*</li>
    <li>PAW label now acts as a color coded STATUS label - dynamically updating</li>
    <li>Known Issue Tracker</li>
    <ul { list-style-type: square;}>
      <li>[BUG 0.0.1.6a] Does not seeming work with BackgroundProcessing or Background Resources mods (being looked at) (so ODFC doesn't work when doesn't have focus). Should not have both BackgroundProcessing and BackgroundResources installed.</li>
      <li>[BUG 0.0.1.9a] B9 module swapping - needs onLoad etc update to make work</li>
      <li>[BUG 0.0.1.9b] next fuel mode should not be visible when only one mode</li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
