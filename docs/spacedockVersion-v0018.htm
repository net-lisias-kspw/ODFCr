<h3> v.0.0.1.8 (DEV BUILD) - Run Fuel Cell, Run!</h3>
<p>
  <ul { list-style-type: square;}>
    <li>ns renamed to newState</li>
    <li>nmax renamed to newMax</li>
    <li>add new recommended mod: HotBeverageIrradiated</li>
    <li>add ODFC and AYA_FuelCell patches for HotBeverageIrradiated</li>
    <li>add ODFC and AYA_FuelCell patches for UniversalStorage2</li>
    <li>fixed typo in StockFuelCells.cfg (replaced '-' with '=')</li>
    <li>[D][BUG 0.0.1.2b] must have some EC to function, if EC == 0 causes ODFC to hang - just had to move two lines of code to execute earlier. Reason this works, why it wasn't working if vessel EC == 0 was the order of execution. Needed to add the generated EC before handling byproducts, and remove fuel which triggered update state.</li>
    <li>Release to Beta-Testers</li>
    <li></li>
    <li>Known Issue Tracker</li>
    <ul { list-style-type: square;}>
      <li>[BUG 0.0.1.6a] Does not seeming work with BackgroundProcessing or Background Resources mods (being looked at) (so ODFC doesn't work when doesn't have focus). Should not have both BackgroundProcessing and BackgroundResources installed.</li>
